# lm358-schmitt-trigger-oscillator
Showing how an LED blinks periodically using an LM358 IC. 
An LED oscillator circuit built using an LM358 op-amp, demonstrating analog circuit design, Schmitt trigger operation, and systematic debugging.
This project evolved from a broken 555 timer IC into a learning journey through op-amp circuit design, hysteresis, and real-world debugging. The final circuit successfully oscillates an LED with clean digital switching using only analog components.

The MATHS: 
Frequency was found to be 0.36Hz rounding to about 20 blinks per minute.
The period is 2.8 seconds per cycle
This was powered by a 5V source (using Arduino Uno and USB as power source directly from my PC).
Used 5 10k ohm resistors, 1 220uF capacitor, 1 LM358 IC and 1 red LED.
